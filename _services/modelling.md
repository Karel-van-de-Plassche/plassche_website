            <h3>Complex systems, complex data</h3>
            <p> Nuclear fusion is a vast field, with numerous physics phenomena, diverse experimental setups, complex calculations, and simulations conducted by various research teams.  Given that data is generated over a variety of geometries and physical parameters, structured frameworks and interfaces are necessary to ensure seamless interoperability between teams and their respective data structures.</p>
            <p>ITER is developing a standard for fusion data, the Integrated Modelling and Analysis Suite (IMAS).
            We have developed a <a href="/news/2021/03/21/ITER-IMAS-Python">pythonic, flexible interface</a> for data stored with the IMAS Access Layer. We are now working on enabling access with the modern data processing ecosystem, using tooling such as xarray, netCDF and intake.
